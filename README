Inventory Management Application: aka the IM BUSY app

Current Issues: 
- running the docker-compose doesn't create the database for some reason. 
  - solution: I manually created the database after running the docker compose to continue to work on CRUD functionality
- Passwords (not real) are currently unencrypted and authentication is currently non-existant
  - solution: none yet
- Database password and username currently visible in the docker-compose.yaml
  - solution: need to import variables from the .env, however implementation has not been achieved
- API currently allows for duplicate users/usernames

API GUIDE:
Endpoints: 
  - /inventory
  - /users
    - Options:
      - ?username=* (replace the * with the username) returns an entry that has a matching username;
        ex: `http://localhost:8080/users/?username=fireball` returns:
        [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "firstName": "Dan",
                "lastName": "Miller",
                "userName": "fireball",
                "password": "1111"
            }
        ]
      - ?id=* (replace the * with the id) returns an entry that has a matching id;
        - ex: `http://localhost:8080/users/?username=1` returns:
          [
              {
                  "id": 1,
                  "firstName": "Dan",
                  "lastName": "Miller",
                  "userName": "fireball",
                  "password": "1111"
              }
          ]
