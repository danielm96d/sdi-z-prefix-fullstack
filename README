Inventory Management Application: aka the IM BUSY app

SETUP:
- make sure to manually setup the database through the terminal if problems arrise on startup
- be sure to manually load up the test data as well. (knex migrations and seeds)

Current Issues: 
- running the docker-compose doesn't create the database for some reason. 
  - solution: I manually created the database after running the docker compose to continue to work on CRUD functionality
- Database password and username currently visible in the docker-compose.yaml
  - solution: need to import variables from the .env, however implementation has not been achieved

API GUIDE:
Endpoints: 
  - /inventory
  - /users
    - Options:
      - ?username=* (replace the * with the username) returns an entry that has a matching username;
        ex: `http://localhost:8080/users/?username=fireball` returns:
        [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "firstName": "Dan",
                "lastName": "Miller",
                "userName": "fireball",
                "password": "1111"
            }
        ]
      - ?id=* (replace the * with the id) returns an entry that has a matching id;
        - ex: `http://localhost:8080/users/?username=1` returns:
          [
              {
                  "id": 1,
                  "firstName": "Dan",
                  "lastName": "Miller",

Description:
  This application is an inventory management application that allows users to track their internal inventory at a basic level.
  A user account is not necessary to use the application; However, you can only view the Master inventory list without an 
  account and will be limited to only viewing and not editing.

  The Inventory master list can be reached at the Master Inventory button on the top bar.
  The user Inventory can be reached at the username's inventory button on the same bar, but will only appear if you are logged in

  Login button is located in the elipses(...) dropdown button on the top bar and is replace by the logout button if you are logged in.

  Clicking on any item in the master list will take you to the more detailed view for that item.
  If you are logged in and you click on an item in the master list that you own then you will be redirected to a page that shows you the details
  and allows you to edit that item.
  If you are logged in and you click on an item in the master list that you do not own then you will be taken to the same un-editable page that 
  non-user's see.
  Navigating to the User specific inventory will give you a truncated list of only items that you own and has the same funcitonality as the master list
  except you will only be taken to the editable page when clicking on one of your own items

  If you wish to edit a specific item while on the item-details page, you need to click on the green button at the top to enable edits;
  no edits will be saved unless you click the submit button

  If you wish to delete a specific item, you just need to click the red trash button on the item-details page.

  If you wish to add a specific item to your inventory you need to click on the blue + button at the bottom of your user-details(user inventory) page
  Doing so will bring up a ui filling out the details of this new item once you click the checkmark at the bottom the item will be added to you inventory
